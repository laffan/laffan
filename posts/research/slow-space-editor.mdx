The Slow Space Editor is a 2D tool that allows users to easily design 3D immersive "slow spaces" in VR without requiring technical expertise. This project emerged from my concerns about how XR technologies might impact our attention in the future. While smartphones have shown detrimental effects on emotional regulation, memory, and attention control, I saw an opportunity for XR to move in a different direction by creating environments specifically designed for reflection and attention restoration.

Users create environments by manipulating a top-down grid, which translates instantly into a 3D VR preview. This approach ensures that even those unfamiliar with XR can design meaningful, personalized restorative spaces. The study also explored key design principles such as environmental dynamism, engagement with nature, and affordances that evoke a sense of place and comfort.

My research approach combined environmental psychology with human-computer interaction principles. I first defined the concept of "slow space" based on research showing the mental health benefits of natural environments and territories. Then, I conducted interviews with professional designers about how restorative spaces are created in the physical world, learning the importance of rapid prototyping, realistic dynamism, and designing for exploration. These insights directly informed my design process.

The Slow Space Editor uses a simple 2D grid interface with drag-and-drop functionality that controls a 3D environment in real-time. Users can create walls, change ground textures, place natural objects, and adjust lighting without needing VR expertise. 

In a 19-person user study, participants quickly grasped the tool with minimal instruction, creating personalized spaces for reflection that often incorporated elements of safety, physical comfort, and storytelling. Even those with no prior VR experience found it intuitive and enjoyable.

This project demonstrates how we might broaden access to the restorative benefits of immersive environments, particularly for populations who can't easily access green spaces due to mobility or health issues. By radically simplifying the creation of virtual environments, the Slow Space Editor challenges the norm of attention-grabbing technology and instead offers a tool for restoring our capacity for focus and reflection. The study revealed exciting possibilities for future development.
