When I graduated from high school, I was given my first digital camera. Compared to the high-tech super phones of today, it was archaic, but I carried it with me wherever I went, and before long folders of images cluttered my hard drive with nowhere to go. In the era before Instagram, just how to _share_ these images became an important question. I began designing a new photo album each year, trying out different ideas that tackled different problems that arise from a nonstop media feed.

What emerged was a kind of iterative experiment in narrative. Some years the images were just accompanied with a simple caption, others the images would be lumped in to themed albums, others were text-heavy, while still involved the creation of whole content management systems which managed interstitial writings, video content, embedded slideshows, panos and more.

After 12 years of this, I decided to combine all of the years in to a single, monolithic collection that utilized the best ideas from the various versions. Palinopsia is a mixture of conventional storytelling techniques that you might find of Flickr or Facebook, alongside some less conventional methods that allow you to explore images in a nonlinear way, or at different levels of granularity.

At its base, it is divided in two, with the first half being a command-line tool that sorts, manages and exports the images and the second being the site itself, which is a React-based web app.
