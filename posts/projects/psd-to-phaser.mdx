psd-to-phaser is a pair of tools that work together to reconstruct a PSD inside Phaser. First is the generator, which outputs the layers as individually optimized files. The generator then creates a JSON manifest that is read by the second tool, a Phaser plugin. The plugin reads the JSON, loads the files and then does the work of rebuilding everything inside Phaser.
