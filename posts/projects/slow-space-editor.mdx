The Slow Space Editor is a research-driven tool designed to simplify the creation of virtual environments for reflection and attention restoration within XR. Rooted in human-centered computing and environmental psychology, the project investigates how immersive virtual spaces can facilitate contemplation and mental well-being. 

By defining the concept of "slow space" and drawing on insights from professional designers, the research establishes a framework for building digital environments that encourage focus and relaxation. Through an accessible, 2D-to-3D editor, users can effortlessly design restorative spaces without prior XR expertise, broadening the accessibility of virtual environments for those who may lack access to physical green spaces.

The development of the Slow Space Editor followed a Research through Design (RtD) methodology, integrating findings from interviews with architects, landscape designers, and interior specialists. The tool was built using Unreal Engine 5.2 for realistic rendering while leveraging a simple 2D interface for rapid prototyping and ease of use. 

Users create environments by manipulating a top-down grid, which translates instantly into a 3D VR preview. This approach ensures that even those unfamiliar with XR can design meaningful, personalized restorative spaces. The study also explored key design principles such as environmental dynamism, engagement with nature, and affordances that evoke a sense of place and comfort.

A qualitative study with 19 participants revealed promising insights into how users engage with virtual restorative spaces. Participants instinctively designed spaces that emphasized safety, bodily comfort, and storytelling, often inspired by personal memories. Many highlighted the need for more dynamic elements, such as changing light, ambient sounds, and moving wildlife, to enhance realism and engagement. 

The study also uncovered strong social potential, with most users expressing interest in co-creating or sharing their spaces. The project underscores the potential of XR to support mental well-being and calls for future research into enhancing interactivity, personalization, and collaborative creation in digital restorative environments.
