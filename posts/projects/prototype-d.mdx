What might it feel like to be *inside* the instrument you are playing?   What might that instrument look like? How might you go about using it?

Prototype D is a VR "instrument" that places the user inside a mysterious landscape that is controlled by a MIDI keyboard. When the user plays a key on the keyboard, one of the structures within the world glows, producing a low, spectral sound.

Prototype D started as an assignment that soon merged with research I was doing for a paper on environment psychology.  The aesthetic began as a simple response to the time constraints of the project, but its simplicity soon became central to the experience.
