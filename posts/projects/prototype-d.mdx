What might it feel like to be *inside* the instrument you are playing?   What might that instrument look like? How might you go about using it?

Prototype D is an VR "instrument" that places the user inside a mysterious landscape that can be controlled by a MIDI keyboard in the real world. When the user plays a key on the keyboard, one of the structures within the world glows, producing a low, spectral sound.

This was a side project, created while I was researching environment psychology for a paper.  The aesthetic began as a simple response to the time constraints of the project, but its simplicity soon became central to the experience, informing other aspects of the environment.

A video of the space being played can be viewed [here](https://vimeo.com/1066349420).
