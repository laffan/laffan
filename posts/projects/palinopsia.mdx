Palinopsia is the final phase of an ongoing photo website that was the home for my personal images from 2006-2022.  For the first twelve or so years I re-designed and re-coded the entire project from the ground up, in what became a set of experiments in storytelling, archiving, and the means by which UI design can confer meaning upon the media it contains.  These experiments were begun before smartphones made photo sharing ubiquitous, and have come to represent an alternative path to the the photo-archive-as-advertising-engine which props up most photo sharing platforms today.


What emerged was a kind of iterative experiment in narrative. Some years the images were just accompanied with a simple caption, others the images would be lumped in to themed albums, others were text-heavy, while still involved the creation of whole content management systems which managed interstitial writings, video content, embedded slideshows, panos and more.
