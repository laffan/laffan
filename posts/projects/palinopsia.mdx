When I graduated from high school, I was given my first digital camera. Compared to the high-tech super phones of today, it was archaic, but I carried it with me wherever I went, and before long folders of images cluttered my hard drive with nowhere to go. In the era before Instagram, just how to _share_ these images became an important question. I began designing a new photo album each year, trying out different ideas that tackled different problems that arise from a nonstop media feed.

What emerged was a kind of iterative experiment in narrative. Some years the images were just accompanied with a simple caption, others the images would be lumped in to themed albums, others were text-heavy, while still involved the creation of whole content management systems which managed interstitial writings, video content, embedded slideshows, panos and more.
