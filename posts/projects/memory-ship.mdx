Designed and built for a friend's wedding, the Memory Ship was an immersive installation piece which allowed users to navigate through a projected world of video clips using a captain's wheel. The barn functioned both as a way for the guests to learn more about the bride and groom as well as a mysterious, building-sized toy.

### Process

At the back of the wedding venue was an old shed - a tiny  barn, really -  which we cleaned out and equipped with a projector and an old bedsheet on the far wall.  In a virtual environment, I positioned the videos around a giant circle, and surrounded them with a particle system of glowing orbs. The orbs used the same HEX palette that controlled a series of Japanese lanterns flanking the physical screen.  To control the entire thing, a captains' wheel was placed at the center of the room, mounted on a wooden pedestal and connected to a rotary encoder. The rotary encoder controlled the both virtual environment and the Japanese lanterns, blurring the conceptual line between the two.


### Emergent Play
The response was overwhelmingly positive, with groups gathering at the captain's wheel for long stretches of time. Because the videos were staggered - groom - bride - groom - bride - stories began to blur, and a kind of super narrative emerged, much to the delight of the guests.  Grandparents in particular enjoyed revisiting the videos, and would delegate younger cousins to operate the wheel for them.
