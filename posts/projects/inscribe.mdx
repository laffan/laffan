Inscribe is a WebXR-based virtual reality (VR) environment designed to facilitate personal reflection by offering users control over their immersive surroundings. Drawing from principles in neuroarchitecture, environmental psychology, and landscape design, Inscribe enables users to modify environmental parameters, such as spatial design and natural elements, to cultivate a personalized and contemplative atmosphere. 

The platform also incorporates a browser-based dashboard where users can upload personal media, fostering a sense of ownership over their reflective space. By leveraging VR’s potential to create accessible, distraction-free environments, Inscribe seeks to explore how digital spaces can support emotional well-being through guided reflection.

The Inscribe experience is structured around three core elements: the environment, the reflection table, and the dashboard. The environment consists of a customizable architectural space, a surrounding garden, and an expansive digital landscape, all designed with evidence-based principles that enhance comfort and psychological safety.

The reflection table serves as an interactive journaling tool, allowing users to document their thoughts within the VR experience and revisit them later via the dashboard. This multi-modal approach ensures continuity between the virtual and real worlds, promoting ongoing engagement with reflective practices. Additionally, Inscribe integrates concepts from attentional restoration theory, which suggests that carefully designed immersive spaces can enhance cognitive focus and emotional processing.


Currently in its prototype phase, Inscribe is set to undergo a research-through-design study to evaluate its impact on user reflection. Future developments aim to introduce social reflection features, enabling shared contemplative experiences in virtual space. 




By making Inscribe accessible through WebXR, the project emphasizes inclusivity, ensuring that individuals without dedicated reflective spaces in the physical world—such as hospital patients or those in assisted living—can benefit from a purposefully designed virtual environment. Inscribe represents a step forward in exploring VR’s role in fostering mindfulness, self-awareness, and emotional resilience, with potential applications in therapeutic and educational contexts.
