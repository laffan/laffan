The Slow Space editor was the major through-line of my work during my time with the SET Lab. Slow Spaces is a multi-stage research exploration into how VR might be used to create calm, reflective, attention-restorative spaces that are accessible to the widest possible range of users. Initially focussed on bringing lessons from neuroarchitecture into the virtual space, successive iterations focussed on making higher-fidelity slow space design accessible to a wider range of users.
