Inscribe is a WebXR-based VR environment designed to facilitate personal reflection.  It does this by offering users control over their immersive surroundings, drawing from principles in neuroarchitecture, environmental psychology and landscape design. Inside the environment, users can interact with images and text they have uploaded via an attached 2D website, and edit text documents.

Inscribe is built with WebXR ( [react-three-fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/)) , and, as such, is accessible to everyone with a headset. The idea was that this would help reach without physical reflection spaces, like hospital patients or people in assisted living.

The world has three main parts: the environment, reflection table, and dashboard. The reflection table works as an interactive journal where users record thoughts in VR and review them later on the dashboard.

Currently a prototype, Inscribe will undergo research to evaluate its impact on reflection. Future plans include adding social features for shared experiences in virtual space.

The project explores how VR can promote mindfulness, self-awareness, and emotional resilience, with potential uses in therapy and education.
