Escape! was my entry for the 2020 Global Game jam.  The theme that year was "repair", so in this game, you are tasked with repairing two things : a broken wall to keep them out, and a broken bridge to make your escape.  Build up the wall with the bricks, lay down boards to fix the bridge. 

### Process

The game was built using Unity 2019, and utilized a first-person controller from the Standard Assets library.  Apart from the boards and bricks, which I modeled in Blender, all 3D assets were collected from various clearinghouses around the internet.  It was my first attempt at building a traditional game with Unity.
