          How might the design of reflective &amp; contemplative spaces in the physical world translate to a virtual
          context?</h4>
        <section>

          <p>Much has been written about contemplative design in the physical world. From the ideas of sacred geometry
            or
            the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130h9f6">modes of ritual-architectural presentation</a> to
            tested systems such as the <a
              href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Contemplative-Landscape-Model-for-landscape-evaluation-with-1-to-6-point-scoring-scale_fig3_327078627">Contemplative
              Landscape Model</a>, there are many techniques that can be applied to the design of real-world spaces to
            promote reflective contemplation. </p>
          <p>Virtual reality has long been used as a method for reorienting one's sense of space, often to extraordinary
            artistic effect. And recently, with headsets becoming increasingly accessible to consumers, there has been
            uptick in apps for relaxation and meditation. However, the design of these apps tends to focus on sensory
            deprivation or reproducing wilderness rather than following the principles that would guide the design of a
            similar space in the physical world.</p>
          <p>In this study, we are interviewing design professionals who have experience designing for the physical
            world
            and are interested in reflective contemplation. We hope to learn from how they practice their craft, and
            find
            ways that their methods might be translated to the virtual space. </p>
