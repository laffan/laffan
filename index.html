              Nate Laffan creates interactive experiences and practical tools
              that help people construct meaning from their lived experience.
              His work focusses on environmental psychology, reflection,
              externalized memory and emergent narrative. Currently, Nate is
              studying reflective practices in VR, and how precepts from
              landscape architecture and environmental psychology can help
              individuals relate to virtual space.
